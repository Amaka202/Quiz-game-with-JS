# Quiz-game-with-JS
My Javascript game has five random questions and four options each.
You are to choose one option out of the four.
the correct answer gets a green background onclick while the worng answer gets a red background.
There is also a score recorder to record the score in realtime.
Then at the end too your score gets displayed.
